# RASA framework implementation research

## definitions
* `rasa` is the framework. It is comprised of two distinct parts:
  * `NLU` which processes natural language understanding tasks to generate a language model,
  * and `Core` which processes the expression.
  
  Both are trained separately.
* `rasa x` is the interface that helps users manage, train and deploy their rasa model.
